🎯 Business Understanding
The primary goal of this project is to identify specific geographical areas with poor mobile network coverage. Based on the data analysis, the project will provide actionable recommendations for network improvements, such as optimizing antenna placements.




📊 Data Understanding
The dataset was compiled from two main sources:

Publicly available data from OpenCellID.

Field measurements collected on-site.

Data was aggregated and processed using Python scripts and stored in a SQL database for analysis.




🛠️ Technologies
This project was built using the following technologies:

Python: For data collection and cleaning, utilizing libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

SQL (MySQL): For data storage and querying.

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.




📈 Visualizations
Below are screenshots of the project's Power BI dashboard, highlighting key findings such as signal strength heatmaps and coverage gaps.

Approach
Data Collection & Cleaning: Aggregated signal strength data from OpenCellID and field tests, then cleaned it to remove anomalies.

Geospatial Analysis: Mapped the data to visualize and pinpoint areas with consistently poor coverage.

Recommendations: Formulated suggestions for antenna adjustments and potential new tower locations based on the analysis.
